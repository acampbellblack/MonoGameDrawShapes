# MonoGame Draw Shapes

Extension methods for SpriteBatch and GraphicsDevice to draw primitives in MonoGame.

I have created this so that I can port Raylib example games to MonoGame.

Simply paste these files into your project.

Drawing the first time will create the buffers, they will be re-used on further calls to avoid unneccessary allocations.
